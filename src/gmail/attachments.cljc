  "Download an inbound message's attachment content. Gmail does NOT inline a
  large attachment's bytes into the `messages.get`/`threads.get` payload --
  the attachment part carries only a `:body {:attachmentId ... :size N}`
  descriptor (which gmail.mime/attachment-parts surfaces), and the actual
  bytes are fetched on demand from a separate endpoint. This namespace is
  that fetch, so a caller that found an attachment via gmail.mime can
  actually retrieve it.

  `users.messages.attachments.get` lives under `/messages/{messageId}/...`,
  NOT `/threads/...` -- but gmail.client/api-base already ends in
  `/users/me`, so the path is just the message/attachment tail. REST v1,
  JVM-only, same injectable-`:http-fn` posture as every other namespace here."
