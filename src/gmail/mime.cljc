  "Decode INBOUND Gmail messages -- the read counterpart to gmail.drafts'
  write side. `threads.get`/`messages.get` (format=full, which
  gmail.threads/get-thread already uses) hand back each message as a
  `:payload` tree: `{:headers [{:name :value} ...] :mimeType \"...\"
  :body {:data \"<base64url>\" :size N} :parts [...]}`, where multipart
  messages nest recursively under `:parts`. Nothing else in this library
  turns any of that back into usable content -- callers were left holding
  raw base64url strings and a headers vector -- so a triage/reply workflow
  (\"what did they actually say, and did they attach anything?\") had no
  portable way to read a message it just fetched. This namespace closes
  that: base64url body decoding, case-insensitive header lookup, and the
  recursive walk that pulls the text/plain (or text/html) body and the
  attachment descriptors out of an arbitrarily nested part tree.

  Pure `.cljc` shape; the base64 decode is JVM-only (`java.util.Base64`),
  the same single-platform posture as gmail.drafts' encoder."

  standard decoder would reject them. nil/blank input returns nil rather
