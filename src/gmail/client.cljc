(ns gmail.client
  "Portable core for talking to the Gmail API v1 -- one auth/HTTP boundary
  for every gmail.* namespace in this library.

  Query construction and response parsing are pure .cljc. The actual HTTP
  call is JVM-only by default (java.net.http) but always takes an
  injectable `:http-fn` -- the same `{:url :method :headers :body} ->
  {:status :body}` convention as cloudflare.client (kotoba-lang/com-cloudflare)
  and cloud-itonami.runtime/jvm-http-fn -- so every namespace here is
  testable with a stub, never only against a live account.

  Auth is a bearer OAuth2 access token. Obtaining/refreshing that token (the
  OAuth2 consent flow itself) is out of scope for this library -- callers
  pass a valid token, the same way cloudflare.client expects a
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN rather than performing its own auth flow."

  non-ASCII survives intact in the URL instead of corrupting the
  query-string syntax. java.net.URLEncoder is deliberately NOT used: it is
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which serializes a space as `+` (a
  literal `+` in a URI, not a space -- ambiguous) and over-encodes `:`/`/`,
  the two characters Gmail search syntax (`from:`, `after:2024/01/01`) most
  needs to stay readable and that RFC 3986 already permits unencoded in a
  query component. Instead: keep RFC 3986 `unreserved` (ALPHA/DIGIT/`-._~`)
  plus the query-legal `:`/`/`, and percent-encode every other byte (UTF-8),
  so the delimiters space/`&`/`=`/`+`/`#` can never be misread as syntax.
  Keys are left unencoded on purpose -- in this codebase they are always
  simple identifiers (q/maxResults/pageToken). This does NOT add repeated-key
  support (still one value per key) -- that larger design decision stays
  documented as out of scope in gmail.history's ADR addendum."

(defn request!
  "Call a Gmail API v1 endpoint. `path` is relative to api-base (e.g.
  \"/threads\" or (str \"/threads/\" thread-id)). `opts` accepts :method
  (default :get), :body (a map, JSON-encoded), :query (a map of query
  params), :http-fn, :token. Returns the parsed JSON body, or nil for an
  empty body (Gmail returns an empty 200 for some modify calls). Throws on
  a transport-level non-2xx status.

  `:retry` (optional, OPT-IN) turns on retry/backoff for transient failures
  via gmail.retry/with-retry: pass `true` for the defaults (5 attempts,
  full-jitter exponential backoff) or a map of gmail.retry/with-retry opts
  (`{:max-attempts N :base-ms M :max-ms K :sleep-fn f}`). OMITTING `:retry`
  entirely preserves the exact prior behavior byte-for-byte -- one request,
  throw immediately on the first non-2xx -- so this is additive/non-breaking
  for every existing caller (and for com-cloudflare/com-wise, which share the
  sync `:http-fn` convention). Only the transient statuses 429/5xx are
  retried; a 401/403/404 still throws on the first try."
