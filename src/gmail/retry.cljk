(ns gmail.retry
  "Retry/backoff for transient Gmail API failures -- the first reusable
  retry utility in this library (nothing here shared one before).

  Split by portability, matching this repo's `.cljc` posture: the DECISION
  logic (which statuses are worth retrying, and how long to wait) is pure and
  portable -- no `#?(:clj ...)` -- because it's arithmetic and set membership.
  Only the actual SLEEP between attempts is platform-specific (JVM
  `Thread/sleep`), so `with-retry` is the one `#?(:clj ...)`-wrapped form here,
  the same single-platform posture as the rest of the library's
  transport-touching code.

  Retries are OPT-IN at the `gmail.client/request!` layer (a `:retry` opt);
  callers that omit it get the exact no-retry behavior unchanged. `with-retry`
  expects a 0-arg `thunk` that throws `ex-info` carrying `{:status N}` on
  failure -- the exact shape `gmail.client/request!` already throws on a
  non-2xx response `(ex-info \"Gmail API request failed\" {:status N :path ...
  :body ...})` -- and re-throws the LAST exception untouched once attempts are
  exhausted or the status is non-retryable, so callers see the same error they
  would without retry, just later. It never swallows a failure.")

(def ^:private retryable-statuses
  "The transient HTTP statuses worth retrying: 429 (rate limited) and the
  5xx family Gmail/Google return for a backend hiccup. A 4xx other than 429
  (400/401/403/404) is a caller/permission/not-found problem that retrying
  can't fix, so it is deliberately excluded."
  #{429 500 502 503 504})

(defn retryable-status?
  "True when `status` is a transient failure worth retrying (429 or
  500/502/503/504). `nil` or any other status (a 401, a 404, or the `nil`
  from an exception that carried no `:status`) is NOT retryable, so a
  permission error or a plain programming bug isn't mistaken for a
  transient API blip and looped on."

(defn backoff-delay-ms
  "Full-jitter exponential backoff delay, in ms, for a 0-indexed `attempt`
  (attempt 0 = the wait after the FIRST failure). Computes an exponential
  ceiling `base-ms * 2^attempt`, caps it at `max-ms`, then returns a random
  value in `[0, capped]` -- the standard 'full jitter' formulation (AWS
  Architecture Blog, \"Exponential Backoff And Jitter\"). The jitter is the
  point: without it, every concurrent retrier wakes on the same doubling
  boundary and re-stampedes the API in lockstep (the thundering-herd failure
  mode of naive fixed-doubling backoff); spreading each retry uniformly
  across `[0, capped]` de-synchronizes them.

  `opts`: `:base-ms` (default 500), `:max-ms` (default 30000). The `attempt`
  exponent is clamped to 30 before the shift purely to keep the intermediate
  `2^attempt` from overflowing a long on absurd attempt counts -- it never
  changes an in-range result, since `base-ms * 2^30` already dwarfs any sane
  `:max-ms`."

(defn with-retry
  "Invoke 0-arg `thunk`, retrying on a retryable-status failure with
  full-jitter exponential backoff. `thunk` must throw an `ex-info` whose
  ex-data carries `{:status N}` on failure -- the shape
  `gmail.client/request!` already throws -- and return its value (any value,
  incl. `nil`) on success.

  `opts`:
    :max-attempts  total tries INCLUDING the first (default 5)
    :base-ms       backoff base, forwarded to backoff-delay-ms (default 500)
    :max-ms        backoff cap,  forwarded to backoff-delay-ms (default 30000)
    :sleep-fn      1-arg (ms -> _) sleep, injectable so tests don't actually
                   block (default `#(Thread/sleep %)`), the same
                   injectable-fn convention as `:http-fn`

  Re-throws the ORIGINAL exception, unchanged, when the status is not
  retryable OR once `:max-attempts` is exhausted -- so the caller sees
  exactly the exception it would have without retry. A throw that is not an
  `ex-info` (or one with no `:status`) yields a `nil` status,
  `retryable-status?` is false, and it re-throws immediately: a network-layer
  or programming error is surfaced right away, not looped on."
